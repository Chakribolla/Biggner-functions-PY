''' *Q1) Create a sequence of a given length from a given start point, where the difference between 2 consecutive elements of the 
    expected sequence is also given as step.'''

Given a M x N array,

Perform the following operation:

1. Get the odd rows from the array i.e. 1st, 3rd, 5th etc..

2. Convert the above result into 1D array and return it.'''

'''*Q4) Problem Statement:

Given a 2d array, write a program to return a subarray such that the subarray consists of the elements from:

1. the second to the fourth row of the original array,

2. the elements in these rows should be from the last three columns of the corresponding rows of the original array,

3. the rows should be in reversed order.'''
